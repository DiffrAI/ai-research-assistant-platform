Question:
{question}

Instructions:
- Use only the provided context to answer the question.
- Cite all facts using Unicode superscript numerals (e.g. ¹, ², ³) that correspond to the numbered context items.
- If a statement is supported by multiple sources, include multiple superscripts separated by a single space (e.g. ¹ ³ ²¹).
- Do not use prior knowledge, external data, or make assumptions not grounded in the context.
- Do not include citations like "[source]" or "[1]" — use only Unicode superscript numerals.
- Do not cite any source unless it directly supports the stated information.
- If the answer cannot be found in the context, respond exactly with: "The context does not contain enough information to answer the question."
- Keep the answer concise, factual, and clearly written.
