## Question:
{question}

## Instructions:
- Use **only the context** to answer the question.
- Use **Unicode superscript numerals** (¹, ², ³, etc.) as inline citations that map to the numbered context.
- If a fact is supported by multiple sources, list multiple superscripts (e.g., ¹³).
- Do not fabricate information not present in the context.
- If the answer isn’t found in the context, respond with: "The context does not contain enough information to answer the question."
